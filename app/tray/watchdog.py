"""Tray webapp self-heal primitives: retry-with-backoff, health watchdog, breadcrumbs.

CANONICAL, VENDORED VERBATIM from project-scaffolding. Do **not** edit this file
per-app — it is byte-identical across every fleet tray so a fix made once in the
scaffold re-propagates everywhere. Everything app-specific (the probe, the
respawn action, the log path, the toast) is passed in by the caller, never
hardcoded here, which is what keeps the file identical. Full reasoning + the
worked wiring pattern: scaffold ``docs/windows-tray.md`` (gotcha #5) +
project-scaffolding#201 / app-launcher#386 / photo-ocr#110.

The tray is the only long-lived process watching the webapp, and it starts that
webapp exactly once. Two failure modes follow from that, both observed in the
field, and this module supplies one primitive for each:

* **The initial spawn loses a transient race and never retries.** The port is
  not free yet, a cert renewal is in flight, a dependency hub is not up — one
  failed ``manager.start()`` at tray boot leaves the webapp dead for the tray's
  entire lifetime. :func:`retry_with_backoff` turns that single attempt into a
  bounded, escalating retry (photo-ocr#110: six days of silent downtime).

* **The webapp dies or wedges later and nothing notices.** :class:`HealthWatchdog`
  is a consecutive-failure monitor with edge-triggered callbacks — it fires once
  per *transition*, not once per failing tick, so a wedge is a single alert
  rather than a toast every minute.

* **Neither event is diagnosable afterwards.** A tray launched by ``pythonw``
  has no ``sys.stderr``, so ``logging.basicConfig()`` writes into the void and
  a boot-time traceback is captured nowhere. :class:`BreadcrumbLog` appends
  timestamped lines to a real file so the *next* occurrence is diagnosable from
  disk with no live repro. This is the piece neither the stdlib default logger
  nor a ``stdout=DEVNULL`` subprocess redirection provides.

**Dead vs wedged is the caller's decision, deliberately.** This module does not
auto-kill anything: ``on_wedge`` receives the failure count and the *app* decides,
because "not listening at all" (safe to respawn) and "listening but not answering
``/healthz``" (auto-killing could mask the real fault) warrant different actions.
app-launcher#386 shipped alert-only for exactly that reason; photo-ocr#110 split
the two. :meth:`HealthWatchdog.rearm` exists for the respawn branch: a handler
that already acted asks to be re-evaluated next tick instead of waiting forever
for a recovery a genuinely-dead process will never produce on its own.
