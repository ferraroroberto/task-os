"""Pooled, keep-alive outbound HTTP client for long-lived processes (#192).

A bare ``requests.get``/``requests.post`` inside a poll loop, health check, or
per-item fan-out opens a fresh TCP connection every call. On Windows each
closed connection parks its ephemeral port in ``TIME_WAIT`` for ~120s against
a 16,384-entry range, so a busy poller is enough to exhaust the range and
stall every process on the machine from opening any outbound socket for
minutes (root cause: ``fleet-config#440``). ``app-launcher#605`` measured 145
such sockets to one sibling process's port at a single sample, dropping to 0
after adopting this pattern.

Vendor-verbatim: consuming apps copy this file byte-identical into their own
`src/` (like `app/tray/single_instance.py`, `tests/e2e/_e2e_live_guard.py`) —
the pool size and the target URL are call-site arguments, so the copy never
forks.

    usually detects and silently reopens a dead pooled socket before sending,
    but the rarer race where the peer closes mid-send still surfaces as
    `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` before any bytes reach the server.
    Retrying that case is safe even for non-idempotent methods — the failed
